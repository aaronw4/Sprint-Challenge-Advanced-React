- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components come with methods as part of the class. For example, functional components dont have life cycle methods.
You dont have to worry about installing hooks or axios.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

1. Mounting: Rendering the app for the first time.
2. Updating: Rerendering the app when there is a change in state.
3. Unmounting: Closing the app when no longer needed.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

It allows us to write reusable code. 
For example, instead of writing code for multiple inputs and states,
we can write one custom hook and reuse it.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

To make sure the app works and functions the way we intended.
Doing it throughout the process will help us catch mistakes faster.
